\title{Compute the Gini Coefficient of a Signature or Catalogue}
\usage{
sig_gini(signature)
}
\arguments{
\item{signature}{A \code{sigverse} signature or catalogue data.frame.}
}
\value{
A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the Gini coefficient.
}
\description{
Calculates the \strong{Gini coefficient}, a measure of inequality or concentration,
for a \code{sigverse} signature or catalogue. It quantifies how unevenly the mutation
probability mass is distributed across contexts:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{0}: perfectly uniform distribution (e.g. all 96 contexts equal)
\item \strong{1}: total concentration in a single context
}

The Gini coefficient complements entropy-based measures like the Shannon index by capturing
the \emph{inequality} of the distribution, rather than its uncertainty or diversity.

This function uses the \strong{unbiased version} of the Gini coefficient, scaled by \code{K / (K - 1)}
where \code{K} is the number of mutation contexts. This adjustment:
\itemize{
\item Ensures the Gini ranges from 0 to 1 for any number of contexts
\item Makes the measure \strong{comparable across signatures} with different numbers of mutation types
\item Is appropriate for full probability distributions (as in mutation signatures)
}
}
\examples{
library(sigstash)
sigs <- sig_load("COSMIC_v3.3.1_SBS_GRCh38")

sig_gini(sigs[["SBS1"]])  # moderately peaked
sig_gini(sigs[["SBS48"]]) # highly peaked, close to 1
