\title{Compute KL Divergence from a Uniform Signature}
\usage{
sig_kl_divergence(signature, base = exp(1), pseudocount = 1e-12)
}
\arguments{
\item{signature}{A \code{sigverse} signature data.frame. Must contain a \code{fraction} column.}

\item{base}{The logarithmic base to use (default is natural log, \code{exp(1)}). Use 2 for bits.}

\item{pseudocount}{A small positive number added to each term to prevent log(0).}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the KL divergence from uniform.
}
\description{
Calculates the Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL) divergence between a mutational signature
and a uniform distribution. KL divergence quantifies how much the observed
mutation context distribution (the signature) deviates from an equal-weight,
flat profile across all contexts.
}
\details{
A value of 0 indicates a perfectly uniform signature. Higher values indicate
more peaked or biased signatures. KL divergence is commonly used as a measure
of "non-uniformity" or "distinctiveness" of mutation profiles.

A small \code{pseudocount} is added to avoid taking the log of zero when any context
has zero weight.

\examples{
library(sigstash)
signatures <- sig_load("COSMIC_v3.3.1_SBS_GRCh38")
sbs3 <- signatures[["sbs3"]]

# Compute KL divergence (how far is SBS3 from flat?)
sig_kl_divergence(sbs3)

# Use base 2 (bits)
sig_kl_divergence(sbs3, base = 2)
