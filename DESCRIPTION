Description: sigstats provides tools for performing common mathematical operations and transformations on sigverse style signatures and catalogues. 
  This package enables users to create models of mutational signatures, combine them, and reconstruct mutation catalogues. 
  Visualization functions are also included for easy interpretation of the results. 
  `The package is designed to work seamlessly with other sigverse packages like sigstash and sigvis.
